Think of ```/docs``` as the build target---try not to edit anything in here directly. Most of the files here are generated by running ```hatch run json2cv```. If you want to update your website, then edit the files in ```/data``` or ```/templates```, and then re-run ```hatch run json2cv```.

**NOTE**: remember to remove or replace ```docs/CNAME```.
